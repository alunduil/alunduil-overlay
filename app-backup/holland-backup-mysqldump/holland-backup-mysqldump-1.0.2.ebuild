DESCRIPTION="Holland is an Open Source backup framework originally developed at
Rackspace and written in Python. Its goal is to help facilitate backing up
databases with greater configurability, consistency, and ease. Holland currently
focuses on MySQL, however future development will include other database
platforms and even non-database related applications. Because of its plugin
structure, Holland can be used to backup anything you want by whatever means you
want."
