Once transferred to this overlay, repoman f groans over pytest-cov in service_identity and pyasn1-modules in 
charcteristic.   They PASS FINE in my local portage tree.
Something to do with portage accesses eclasses of something beyond which either interests me or I care 
about.
The other way of doing this is for me to git push them in my pverlay which is called
improvise.
I pondered terrorise but decided to go 'nice'.
The final test is to pass repoman full in the local portage tree so these groans to me are
nothing but a nuisance, brown noise.
